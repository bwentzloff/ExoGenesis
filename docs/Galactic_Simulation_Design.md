# Galactic Simulation Design Document

## Vision and Scope

### Overall Purpose
The simulation focuses on the **aesthetic beauty of galactic growth**, providing a mesmerizing and engaging experience for users. While not explicitly educational, it includes a storytelling element by generating a **written history** of the galaxy as it evolves. Users can read about the rise and fall of civilizations and key events, enriching their connection to the simulation.

### Intended Audience
The primary audience includes:
- **Sci-fi Enthusiasts**: Attracted to the expansive and imaginative nature of a dynamic galaxy.
- **Casual Gamers**: Engaged by the relaxing, observation-first approach.
- **Simulation Lovers**: Appreciative of the open-source framework, with opportunities to explore procedural generation and AI mechanics.

### Platform
- **Web Application**: The simulation will be browser-based, optimized for desktops.
- **No Mobile Support**: Initial development will not cater to mobile devices to maintain simplicity.

## Core Mechanics

### Civilization Expansion
- **Autonomous Growth**: Civilizations expand based entirely on AI behaviors, with no user influence.
- **Triggers for Expansion**:
  - **Resource Availability**: Minerals, energy, and other resources.
  - **Technology**: Advances in space travel, colonization, or energy production.
  - **Population Growth**: Increasing populations drive territorial expansion.
  - **Random Events**: Unpredictable phenomena like discovering habitable planets.
- **No Limits**: Civilizations can expand indefinitely if conditions allow.

### Interactions Between Civilizations
- **Trade**: Visualized as glowing lines connecting systems, with moving particles indicating active exchange.
- **War**: Represented by flashing borders, jagged lines between systems, and visual cues of destruction.
- **Alliances**: Indicated by overlapping influence zones and smooth, glowing lines.
- **Dynamic Effects**: Trade expands influence zones, war may shrink them, and alliances create cooperative growth.

### Civilization Behavior and Evolution
- **Traits and Starting Conditions**:
  - Initial traits determined by planetary environment, resource availability, and neighbor proximity.
- **Dynamic Evolution**:
  - Traits and strategies adapt over time (e.g., peaceful civilizations turning aggressive under threat).
  - Long-term specialization in technology, culture, or economics.
- **AI Strategies**:
  - Unique strategies include expansionist, diplomatic, aggressive, or opportunistic behaviors, evolving dynamically.

## Visualization and Aesthetics

### Map Style
- **3D Representation**: A fully 3D galaxy map with a simple, intuitive mechanism for rotating and zooming.
- **Minimalist Retro-Futurism**:
  - Clean lines, vibrant colors, and a dark, starry background.
  - Civilization territories represented by glowing, semi-transparent shapes.
  - Depth suggested by parallax effects and hoverable elements.

### Interactions Visualization
- **Trade Routes**: Flowing cyan or green lines with particle animations.
- **War**: Red jagged lines, flickering borders, and shockwave effects during major battles.
- **Alliances**: Smooth blue or purple lines with shimmering effects across borders.
- **Custom Views**:
  - Filters for trade routes, active wars, or highlighted civilizations.

## Time Controls
- **Real-Time Play**:
  - The galaxy evolves in real-time, with a pace slow enough to unfold over months or years.
- **Pause and Step Forward**:
  - Users can pause the simulation and step forward one tick at a time.
- **Time-Lapse History**:
  - Replay the galaxy’s evolution with smooth animations and highlighted events.

## Procedural Generation
- **Seed-Based Creation**:
  - Galaxies are procedurally generated from a seed, enabling recreation and sharing of specific universes.
- **Detailed Generation**:
  - Star types, planetary systems, resources, and initial civilizations are generated procedurally.
  - Galactic features include black holes, nebulae, and rare celestial phenomena.
- **User Parameters**:
  - Minimal customization options: galaxy size, civilization count, and optional seed input.

## Events and Their Impact

### Types of Events
- **Natural Disasters**: Asteroid impacts, tectonic shifts, solar flares.
- **Galactic Phenomena**: Black hole migrations, supernovae, cosmic storms.
- **Civilization-Specific Crises**: Civil wars, resource depletion, technological accidents.

### Scope of Impact
- **Localized**: Planetary or system-specific effects.
- **Regional**: Sector-wide disruptions, like cosmic storms.
- **Galaxy-Wide**: Rare phenomena impacting all civilizations (e.g., gamma-ray bursts).

### Dynamic Responses
- Civilizations adapt by:
  - Evacuating threatened planets.
  - Shifting trade routes.
  - Innovating technologies to mitigate risks.

## User Interaction and Exploration

### Exploration
- Clickable planets, systems, and civilizations provide detailed stats, including:
  - Population, resources, and technology for planets.
  - Trade routes and ongoing interactions for systems.
  - Traits and historical milestones for civilizations.

### Event Notifications
- **Log Panel**: Chronological event log with filters for event types.
- **Optional Alerts**: Toggleable pop-ups for major events.

### Custom Views
- Filters to highlight specific aspects, such as:
  - Trade routes.
  - Active wars.
  - Civilization influence zones.

### Marking Systems for Tracking
- Users can bookmark systems or planets for easy access, with markers appearing on the map.

## Advanced Features and Future Expansions

### Persistent History
- **Timeline**: A detailed log of galaxy-wide events.
- **Narrative Generation**: Written summaries of the galaxy’s evolution.

### Multiplayer Viewing and Social Sharing
- **Collaborative Exploration**: Real-time shared views for group discussions.
- **Social Media Integration**: Export snapshots or event highlights for sharing.

### Export Options
- **Data Export**: JSON or CSV files of galaxy data.
- **Visual Export**: High-resolution images or animated clips of key events.

### AI Behavior Insights
- **Decision Logs**: Explanations of AI choices (e.g., why a war began).
- **Behavior Metrics**: Graphs of trait evolution over time.
