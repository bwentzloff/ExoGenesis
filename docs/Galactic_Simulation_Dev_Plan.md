# Galactic Simulation: Iterative Development Plan

## Overview
This document outlines an **iterative development plan** for building the Galactic Simulation project, ensuring a structured, modular, and scalable approach. Development will begin with a **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** and expand iteratively, adding features and complexity over time.

## Iterative Development Stages

### **1. Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**

#### **Objective**:
Create a functional prototype to generate and simulate a basic galaxy in real time, with minimal visual and interaction features.

#### **Core Features**:
1. **Galaxy Generation**:
   - Procedurally generate a galaxy with stars, planetary systems, and initial civilizations.
   - Use seeded random generation for reproducibility.
2. **Civilization Expansion**:
   - Simulate autonomous, real-time expansion of civilizations based on proximity and basic logic.
3. **Visual Representation**:
   - 2D or 2.5D map displaying:
     - Stars (glowing dots).
     - Planets (small orbs orbiting stars).
     - Civilization borders (basic glowing outlines).
4. **Basic User Interaction**:
   - Clickable stars to view:
     - Star type.
     - Number and types of planets.
     - Civilization name (if inhabited).
   - Pause/Resume controls.
5. **Time Controls**:
   - Real-time simulation.
   - Pause functionality.

#### **Technology Stack**:
- **Frontend**: Vue.js or React.js + Three.js.
- **Backend**: Python (FastAPI) with PostgreSQL.
- **Procedural Tools**: NumPy and SciPy.
- **Hosting**: Netlify (frontend), AWS Lambda (backend).

#### **Timeline**: 4-6 weeks

#### **Deliverable**: A deployable web application showcasing a simple galaxy with evolving civilizations and basic user interaction.

### **2. Iteration 1: Enhanced Visualization and Data Display**

#### **Objective**:
Improve the visual and informational aspects of the simulation, enhancing user engagement and clarity.

#### **Features**:
1. **Improved Map Style**:
   - Transition to full 3D visualization with Three.js.
   - Add depth effects, parallax scrolling, and refined glowing effects.
2. **Planetary Details**:
   - Display planet types (rocky, gas giant, icy, etc.) with distinct visuals.
   - Show orbital paths and basic planetary attributes (size, habitability).
3. **Event Log**:
   - Add a sidebar to display a chronological log of significant events (e.g., civilization expansion, colonization).
4. **Custom Views**:
   - Filters to highlight trade routes, active wars, or alliances.

#### **Timeline**: 6-8 weeks

#### **Deliverable**: A visually rich, interactive simulation with detailed planetary visuals and event tracking.

---

### **3. Iteration 2: Advanced Civilization Behavior and Interactions**

#### **Objective**:
Introduce dynamic AI-driven behaviors and complex interactions between civilizations.

#### **Features**:
1. **AI Strategies**:
   - Implement AI decision-making for civilizations, including:
     - Expansionist, diplomatic, and aggressive behaviors.
     - Evolution of traits over time.
2. **Interactions**:
   - Add trade routes (visualized with flowing lines).
   - Simulate wars (flashing borders, jagged lines, destruction visuals).
   - Introduce alliances (overlapping borders, cooperative growth).
3. **Dynamic Evolution**:
   - Civilizations adapt based on events (e.g., resource depletion triggering aggression).

#### **Timeline**: 8-10 weeks

#### **Deliverable**: A simulation where civilizations exhibit unique, evolving behaviors and interact dynamically with one another.

---

### **4. Iteration 3: Events and Procedural Complexity**

#### **Objective**:
Add rich, procedurally generated events and increase the depth of galaxy generation.

#### **Features**:
1. **Procedural Events**:
   - Introduce natural disasters (e.g., asteroid impacts, solar flares).
   - Add galactic phenomena (e.g., black holes, cosmic storms).
   - Implement civilization-specific crises (e.g., civil wars, economic collapses).
2. **Event Impact**:
   - Events affect local or regional areas, with cascading consequences for civilizations.
3. **Galaxy Generation**:
   - Expand generation logic to include nebulae, black holes, and rare celestial features.
   - Refine planet distribution and unique traits.

#### **Timeline**: 10-12 weeks

#### **Deliverable**: A dynamic galaxy simulation where procedural events create unpredictable and engaging scenarios.

---

### **5. Iteration 4: Persistent History and Replayability**

#### **Objective**:
Enable users to explore the galaxy’s history and share their simulations.

#### **Features**:
1. **Persistent History**:
   - Save a detailed timeline of events.
   - Generate a narrative summary of the galaxy’s evolution.
2. **Time-Lapse Replay**:
   - Add functionality to replay the galaxy’s history, highlighting key moments.
3. **Export Options**:
   - Export timelines, high-resolution snapshots, and animation clips.
   - Share simulation seeds for reproducibility.

#### **Timeline**: 6-8 weeks

#### **Deliverable**: A simulation with persistent history and replayability, allowing users to explore and share their galaxy.

---

### **6. Iteration 5: Multiplayer Viewing and Collaboration**

#### **Objective**:
Introduce multiplayer capabilities and enhanced open-source collaboration.

#### **Features**:
1. **Collaborative Viewing**:
   - Allow multiple users to view and discuss the same galaxy in real time.
2. **Open-Source Contributions**:
   - Provide clear documentation and modular code to encourage community extensions.
3. **Social Media Integration**:
   - Add features to share snapshots and event highlights directly to social platforms.

#### **Timeline**: 8-10 weeks

#### **Deliverable**: A collaborative simulation with multiplayer viewing and easy sharing of galaxies.
